#### Installation
- Run `npm install` and `./node_modules/.bin/jspm install`
- Run `npm run babel` to compile a Front-end bit.
- Run as a native app: `npm run electron`, runs as a native cross-system app.
- If electron throws an error on SQLite3, do  `./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild` and rerun. This is an issue with electron itself.

#### Plans
- After the first stable release, incorporate OS X installer as a native desktop app.
