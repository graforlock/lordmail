## Mailord

A builder &  the way to deal with responsive email frustration & abstraction layer of creating responsive email templates.

#### TODO
Main functionality:

- Node CLI tool that can be incorporated in the build process.
- Integrate with jeykyll/premailer setup (for the latter, separate styles from the HTML).
- Integrate premailer route for sending test emails.

Secondary functionality:

- Advanced rows edition: Change of text content on the fly;
- Advanced rows edition: MailChimp (hideable, repeatable, variants);


Additional functionality: 

- Improvements in templating engine that facilitate usage of functions (resizing/adjusting images upon editing)
